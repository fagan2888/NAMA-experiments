# NAMA-experiments

This repository contains the test scripts running the experiments contained in
* L. Stella, A. Themelis, P. Patrinos, *Newton-type Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Convex Optimization*, 2017.

In order to run the scripts, the installation of [ForBES](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ForBES) is required (this provides the implementation of the proposed algorithm).
