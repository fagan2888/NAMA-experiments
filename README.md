# NAMA-experiments

This repository contains the test scripts running the experiments contained in
* L. Stella, A. Themelis, P. Patrinos, *Newton-type Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Convex Optimization*, 2017.

[ForBES](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ForBES) must be installed in order to run the scripts (this provides the implementation of the proposed algorithm).
