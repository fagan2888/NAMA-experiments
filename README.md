# NAMA-experiments

This repository contains the test scripts running the experiments contained in L. Stella, A. Themelis, P. Patrinos, *Newton-type Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Convex Optimization*, 2017.

The installation of [ForBES](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ForBES), containing the implementation of the proposed algorithm, is required in order to run the scripts.
